# Logic-Building-Assignment

**Activity 1:**
Design an algorithm to accept 25 integer elements for an array then find the maximum number
in the set and display it.

**Activity 2:**
Design an algorithm to accept 10 integer elements for an array and then find the number of
times the number with the maximum value occurs in the array.

**Activity 3:**
Design an algorithm to print a pyramid based on level entered by the user.

**Activity 4:**
Design an algorithm to calculate the factorial of a number N. The value of N is provided as an
input by the user.

**Activity 5:**
Design an algorithm which accepts 10 integer values, calculates the average and prints it.

**Activity 6:**
Design an algorithm to accept a given string from the user. The algorithm must then remove
characters from the string which appear more than once.

**Activity 7:**
A train running at the speed of x km/hr crosses a pole in y seconds. Design an algorithm to
accept x and y as inputs from the user and then calculate the length of the train.
Note: values of x and y must be positive and non-zero.

**Activity 8:**
A train X m long passes a man, running at 5 km/hr in the same direction in which the train is
going, in Y seconds. Design an algorithm to accept the values of X and Y as input from the user
and then calculate the speed of the train.
Note: values of X and Y must be positive and non-zero.

**Activity 9:**
In an election between two candidates, one got 55% of the total valid votes, 20% of the votes
were invalid. The total number of votes was X (value greater than 5000), design an algorithm to
accept a value for X from the user and calculate the number of valid votes that the other
candidate got.

**Activity 10:**
Design an algorithm to find the least perfect square, which is divisible by each of 21, 36 and 66.

**Activity 11:**
Ravi and Kumar are working on an assignment. Ravi takes 6 hours to type 32 pages on a
computer, while Kumar takes 5 hours to type 40 pages. Design an algorithm to calculate how
much time they will take, working together on two different computers to type an assignment
of 110 pages.

**Activity 12:**
Design an algorithm to accept a number from the user and check if it a prime number or not.

**Activity 13:**
The difference between the length and breadth of a rectangle is 23 m. If its perimeter is 206 m,
design an algorithm to calculate its area.

**Activity 14:**
Design an algorithm to find the greatest number that will divide 43, 91 and 183 so as to leave
the same remainder in each case.

**Activity 15:**
The difference between a two-digit number and the number obtained by interchanging the
positions of its digits is 36. Design an algorithm to find the difference between the two digits of
that number.
